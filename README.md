## The Data Tools Used
•	Microsoft Excel: Excel was used for initial data exploration, cleaning, and basic analysis. Pivot tables and formulas were applied to calculate metrics like average sales 
  per product and total revenue by region.
  
•	SQL: SQL was employed to load and query the dataset within a SQL Server environment. This allowed for more advanced analysis, such as calculating total revenue per 
  product, identifying top-performing products, and analyzing sales trends. SQL also enabled efficient filtering and grouping to derive insights from large volumes of data.
  
•	Power BI: Power BI was used to create an interactive dashboard that visually represents the insights obtained from Excel and SQL analyses. The dashboard includes 
  components like a sales overview, top-performing products, and regional breakdowns, allowing stakeholders to interact with the data and quickly understand key findings.
